# Time Tracker

In my seemingly futile effort at becoming an adult, I'm trying to work towards a solid 40 hour work week.

As such, I wanted to develop a program to help me organize how much time I spend working on various projects.

This program incorporates a GUI which visualizes entries to the user, and fascilitates the process of adding new entries.

This program is meant to work alongside [Thyme](https://github.com/joaomoreno/Thyme), as it reads the JSON files produced by it, appending them to the user-inputted data.
